With the following listed recipes, this chapter introduces a set of common practices for maintaining, debugging, and improving an application state:

* Automating Database Migrations with Flyway

* Unit testing with Mockito and Maven Surefire

* Integration testing with Cargo, Rest-assured, and Maven Failsafe

* Injecting Spring Bean in Integration tests

* Modern application Logging with Log4j2

使用以下列出的配方，本章介绍了一组维护，调试和改进应用程序状态的常用实践：

* 使用Flyway自动进行数据库迁移

* 使用Mockito和Maven Surefire进行单元测试

* 与Cargo，Rest-sure和Maven Failsafe的集成测试

* 在集成测试中注入Spring Bean

* 现代应用程序使用Log4j2记录日志

# Introduction

As we are now approaching the end of this journey, we must see how to consolidate the work. In the real world, tests must be written before a feature is developed \(or at least at the same time\). Writing automated tests in software development conveys a massive confidence about the application state. It is the best way of ensuring that nothing has been forgotten. Having a system that has the ability to test itself, with the help of modern continuous integration tools, ensures that features will not be damaged at any time.

Manual testing through UI cannot be trusted to cover every single edge case that a developer has to think about. It is the responsibility of the developer to secure all the breaches and to cover all the possible paths, and this is a big responsibility.

Our developer job is an amazing job. The perpetual technology enhancement sets an incomparable pace for every one of us—to stay in the race, to respond to the market, and sometimes to lead the market.

Our job is made of long hours of intense focus, search for information, design, redesign, and so on. Writing tests brings a healthy stability in the cycle. It allows us to finish our day happier with the features we develop, even weeks and months later.

我们现在即将结束这次旅程，必须看看如何巩固这项工作。 在现实世界中，测试必须在开发特性之前（或至少在同一时间）进行。 在软件开发中编写自动化测试表达了对应用程序状态的极大信心。 这是确保没有被遗忘的最好方式。 拥有一个能够在现代持续集成工具的帮助下测试自身的系统，确保功能不会在任何时候损坏。

通过用户界面手动测试不能被信任，以支付开发者必须考虑每一个边缘情况。 开发商有责任保护所有违约行为并涵盖所有可能的路径，这是一个重大的责任。

我们的开发工作是一项了不起的工作。 永恒技术的提升为我们每个人创造了无与伦比的步伐 - 停下来，对市场做出反应，同时引领市场。

我们的工作是由长时间的强烈关注，搜索信息，设计，重新设计，等等。 编写测试带来在循环健康稳定性。 它使我们能够完成我们开发的功能，甚至数周和数月之后。
