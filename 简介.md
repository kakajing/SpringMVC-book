You need to complete the first chapter before starting this new one. The first chapter installs the basics for the trading platform we are building. It also creates a modular toolkit that every recipe will be using.

This second chapter sets the product on an acceleration ramp. It will shape the whole chain of responsibilities and draft the big picture of the Microservice architecture. Once more, we will establish a necessary structure for the chapters to come, but on another level.

在开始这个新的之前，你需要完成第一章。 第一章安装我们正在构建的交易平台的基础。 它还创建一个模块化的工具包，每个谱方将使用。

第二章将产品设置为加速斜坡。 它将塑造整个责任链，起草微服务架构的大局。 再次，我们将为以后的章节建立必要的结构，但在另一个层面。

**The User eXperience paradigm    
**

For a couple of years now, we've assisted an amazingly active frontend revolution. Since the rise of HTML 5 and CSS3, with the common development platforms for mobile \(iOS, Android,  
 and so on\), and with the amount of connected devices, so many doors and opportunities have been opened to the developer communities. The frequency of new JavaScript libraries  
 popping-up in the open source field has made it quite difficult to follow.

用户eXperience范式

几年来，我们协助了一个令人惊讶的积极的前端革命。 自从HTML5 5和CSS3的兴起，与普通的移动开发平台（iOS，Android，  
等等），随着连接设备的数量，对开发者社区开放了许多门和机会。 新JavaScript库的频率  
在开源领域的爆发使得相当难以遵循。

But it's a revolution for good! It targets the customer and user experience. The customer nowadays wants to interact with a brand or a product from the desktop, laptop, TV, tablet, mobile, and soon the car. Network connection speeds vary as well from more than 150 megabytes per second to very few bytes per second. The customer can also expect offline features or at least a decent user experience. It's obvious that new challenges have come out of this complexity to improve the user experience.

As our reachability through different means has largely increased, our level of exposure to spam, direct solicitations, advertising, and marketing in general has never been higher. Interestingly, we are now far more sensitive and assertive to every single message that retains our attention online. As it takes us a fraction of second to decide whether something is worth it or not, we reject a poor design for the same reason. We are more demanding and saturated targets, and every brand has to follow the latest UX standards to make us interact with them.

但这是一场革命的好！它以客户和用户体验为目标。现在的客户希望与来自台式机，笔记本电脑，电视，平板电脑，移动设备以及汽车的品牌或产品进行互动。网络连接速度也从每秒超过150兆字节变化到每秒非常少的字节。客户还可以预期离线功能或至少一个体面的用户体验。很明显，新的挑战已经出来了这种复杂性，以改善用户体验。

由于我们通过不同手段的可达性大大增加，我们的垃圾邮件，直接招揽，广告和营销一般的暴露水平从来没有更高。有趣的是，我们现在对每一个在线留言的信息都更加敏感和坚定。因为它需要我们一秒钟来决定某事是否值得，我们拒绝一个糟糕的设计，同样的原因。我们是更苛刻和饱和的目标，每个品牌都必须遵循最新的UX标准，使我们与他们互动。

**Microservice architectures    
**

We have seen already the massive benefits in terms of communication, image, and development that Internet organizations have generated by opening their APIs to the public \(Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and so on\). Such radical changes in IT infrastructures are now becoming the norm for smaller companies and start-ups.

Modern architectures provide documented Public APIs and device-specific installation packages for their clients: mobile apps or responsive HTML contents delivered under specific shots. REST APIs are also a navigable dimension for more autonomous modules of the **Internet of Things \(IoT\)**.

Maybe the main concern remains how to handle the load on the server side, but more computation is transferred to client devices and REST architectures are by definition stateless and consequently a good support for scalability.

**微服务架构    
**

我们已经看到互联网组织通过向公众（Facebook，Twitter，亚马逊等）打开他们的API而产生的通信，形象和开发方面的巨大利益。 IT基础设施的这种根本性变化现在已成为小公司和初创企业的规范。

现代架构为其客户提供了文档化的公共API和特定于设备的安装包：移动应用或在特定镜头下交付的响应式HTML内容。 REST API也是**Internet of Things \(IoT\)**的更多自主模块的可导航维度。

也许主要的关注仍然是如何处理服务器端的负载，但更多的计算转移到客户端设备和REST架构是定义无状态的，因此对可扩展性的良好支持。
